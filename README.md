# hello-world

About me:

I have been in the IT industry for 16 years.  I started out writing scripts and code for office administrators at age 15 when I figured out how to use the Lanier wordprocessors.  Since then, I have been fascinated with every aspect of IT.  I just happened to have gotten away from scripting and coding.  I wish to learn anew all that has changed.

Hello, WORLD!  Christi is awakening!
